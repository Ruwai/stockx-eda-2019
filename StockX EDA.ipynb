So, for each day the Off-White Jordan 1 was on the market, we randomly selected X% of its sale from each day. (It’s not important to know what X is; all that matters is that it’s a random sample, and that the same fixed X% of sales was selected from every day, for every sneaker).\n",

You can use whatever variables you want in the analysis; you can use 1 variable, or you can use all 8. And remember, every row in the spreadsheet represents an individual StockX sale.
